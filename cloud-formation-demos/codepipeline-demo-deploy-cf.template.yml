# This codepipeline demo:
#  1) Grabs source from GitHub whenever it changes
#  2) builds and unit tests in parallel.
#  3) Deploys using CloudFormation

# TO RUN THIS:  You'll need a GitHub Repository, and a GitHub OAuthToken.
# To make a GitHub OAuthToken, go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens
# The default value you see here will work only if you prepend it with a '0'.


Parameters:
  CodePipelineBucketPrefix:
    Description: CodePipeline needs a utility bucket for its internal use.  Specify the prefix for the bucket name

    Default:  b45b4b39fe35179592ceb5259c481b05a0eb27d
    Description:  CodePipeline sources require an OAuthToken, even if they are public.  To make one go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens 

  OutputS3BucketAndPrefix:
    Description: Existing S3 Bucket (and optional folder/prefix) where you want to place output artifacts
